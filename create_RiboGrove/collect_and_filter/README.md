# RiboGrove database creation: sequence collection and filtering

Here you can find scripts that are used for RiboGrove construction.

Each Python script can be used on its own using command line interface. At the same time, they are integrated into a pipeline `collect_and_filter.sh`.

## Description

The pipeline consists of 5 major steps:

1. Download annotated genome sequences in GenBank format from RefSeq.

2. Extract 16S rRNA gene sequences from downloaded genomes.

3. Assign categories to the genomes according to their reliability.

4. Filter gene sequences: remove partial sequences, sequences containing long repeats etc.

5. Annotate final gene sequences and prepare additional files.

The pipeline must be run sparately for bacteria and for archaea.

## Input

## Configuragion file

The pipeline takes a bash-like configuration file (`.conf`) as input. Examples of that configuration files can be found in directory `config/`: `bacteria_example.conf` and `archaea_example.conf`.

A configuration file specifies location of:

1) input data;

2) working directory;

3) dependencies.

Please see examples of configuration files in the directory `config/`.

Also, the configuration file specifies some pipeline parameters, such as Rfam RNA family ID and whether to calculate primer coverages of genomes or not.

## NCBI files to download before run

The pipeline requires the following files downloaded before run:

1. A RefSeq `.catalog.gz` file from [https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-catalog/](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-catalog/). E.g. for RiboGrove 7.213 you should use file `RefSeq-release213.catalog.gz`.

## Usage

The pipeline should be run as follows:

```
bash collect_and_filter.sh <CONFIG_FILE> [-at]
```

### Options

```
-t: Test mode. If specified, the script will not use entire RefSeq,
    but just some genomes from the file
    scripts/data/test/test_bacteria_assembly_summary.txt.gz
    or
    scripts/data/test/test_archaea_assembly_summary.txt.gz

-a: RefSeq catalog file is already filtered.
    If you already have file RefSeq-release216_filtered.catalog.gz
    created from file RefSeq-release216.catalog.gz,
    the script will not run the script filter_refseq_catalog.py again
    and thus save some time.

-x: NCBI taxonomy (new_taxdump.tar.gz) is already downloaded and extracted.
    If you already have the file new_taxdump/rankedlineage.dmp extracted from new_taxdump.tar.gz,
    then the script will not downlaod and extract it again and thus save some time.
```
